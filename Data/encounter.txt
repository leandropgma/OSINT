The number -0.841600711036728 is incorrect. You need to decode it to know the other portion of the coordinates

The number has to be: 

- Divided by the second prime number 
- Subtract value equivalent to Pi π
- Multiply by the number multiple of the first 5 digits (do not simplify) 
- Add the sixth fibonacci value  

The order has to be discovered as I do not want to be obvious about location 

There are four operations. The number 4 is my reference for everything as the location has a relation to that number as well
